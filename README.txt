Good things:
=================
1- The code separates different functionalities into separate methods, making it easier to maintain and understand.
2- The methods rely on dependency injection, which is a good practice for handling dependencies and improving testability.
3- The code appears to be written with reusability in mind, as each method delegates its functionality to a repository, which is a good practice for maintaining clean and maintainable code.
4- Variable names are mostly clear and descriptive, making it easier to understand the purpose of each variable.
5- Logging is used to record important information, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring.

Issues/What Could Be Improved:
=====================
1- The code lacks comments explaining the purpose and functionality of each method. Adding comments would make it easier for other developers (and your future self) to understand the code.
2- The code doesn't appear to include validation for the incoming request data. It's essential to validate user input to ensure data integrity and security.
3- Variable naming is inconsistent. For example, some variables use snake_case, while others use camelCase. Consistency in variable naming makes the code more readable.
4- Proper error handling mechanisms should be implemented to handle potential exceptions or errors that may occur during request processing.
5- The code defines variables. Remove unused variables to maintain clean code.
6- Some values are hardcoded directly into the code, like 'immediatetime' and 'numpages'. It's better to define such constants as class constants or configuration values for easier maintenance.


These are my thoughts what is good, ok and make code terrible for this code.
